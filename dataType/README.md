### 解释
- The Undefined type has exactly one value, called `undefined`. Any variable that has not been assigned a value
has the value `undefined`.

- The Null type has exactly one value, called `null`

- The Boolean type represents a logical entity having two values, called `true` and `false`.

- The Symbol type is the set of all non-String values that may be used as the key of an Object property (6.1.7). Each possible Symbol value is unique and immutable.  

  Each Symbol value immutably holds an associated value called [\[Description]] that is either undefined or a String value.
